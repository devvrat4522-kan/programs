1. **You**: Create a generic stack class with array size of 10 elements. Now make it thread-safe so that the push operation will wait as long as the stack
is full and the pop operation will wait as long as the stack is empty . Then implement two thread classes one performing push and pop operationsand the other one performing pop operations, as
 anonymous inner classes within main method. 

2. **ChatGPT**: To create a generic stack class with an array size of 10 elements, you can start by defining a class called "Stack" with a generic type parameter. Here's an example implementation:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Stack<T> {
    private T[] array;
    private int top;
    private Lock lock;
    private Condition notFull;
    private Condition notEmpty;

    public Stack() {
        array = (T[]) new Object[10];
        top = -1;
        lock = new ReentrantLock();
        notFull = lock.newCondition();
        notEmpty = lock.newCondition();
    }

    public void push(T value) throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (top == array.length - 1) {
                notFull.await(); // Wait until the stack is not full
            }
            array[++top] = value;
            notEmpty.signal(); // Signal waiting threads that the stack is not empty
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public T pop() throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (top == -1) {
                notEmpty.await(); // Wait until the stack is not empty
            }
            T value = array[top--];
            notFull.signal(); // Signal waiting threads that the stack is not full
            return value;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

In this implementation, we use a lock and conditions from the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package to make the stack thread-safe. The `notFull` condition is used to wait for the stack to have space for pushing, and the `notEmpty` condition is used to wait for the stack to have elements for popping.

Now let's implement two thread classes, one for pushing and popping, as anonymous inner classes within the `main` method:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        Thread pushThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                    stack.push(i);
                    System.out.println("Pushed: " + i);
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });

        Thread popThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                    int value = stack.pop();
                    System.out.println("Popped: " + value);
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });

        pushThread.start();
        popThread.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `pushThread` pushes values from 1 to 10 to the stack, while the `popThread` pops values from the stack. Both threads sleep for 100 milliseconds between each operation to simulate concurrent access.

By using the lock and conditions, the push operation will wait if the stack is full (`top == array.length - 1`), and the pop operation will wait if the stack is empty (`top == -1`).
