    "Regularization is one of the most important concepts of machine learning. It is a technique to prevent the model from overfitting by adding extra information to it.\n",
    "This technique can be used in such a way that it will allow to maintain all variables or features in the model by reducing the magnitude of the variables.\n",
    "It mainly regularizes or reduces the coefficient of features toward zero. In simple words, \"In regularization technique, we reduce the magnitude of the features by keeping the same number of features.\""
